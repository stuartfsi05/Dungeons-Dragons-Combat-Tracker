# Isar generated files (optional, but usually we keep them if we want to build without running code gen immediately, 
# but standard practice is to ignore them if they can be regenerated. 
# For this project, let's keep them to make it easier for the user, 
# OR ignore them to keep repo clean. Let's ignore them to follow best practices.)
# *.g.dart
# But wait, for a simple project, sometimes it's better to commit them. 
# I will NOT ignore *.g.dart for now to ensure it runs out of the box without running build_runner.
# If the user wants to be strict, they can add it later.
